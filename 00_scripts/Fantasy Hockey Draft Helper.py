## Import pandas library module for Worksheet/Data manipulation.
import pandas as pd # Import pandas into Python; renamed as "pd" (standard for pandas).
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 14) # Set pandas to display all the columns (otherwise it will truncate with "...").
# Adapted from: How to Show All Columns of a Pandas DataFrame?
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-show-all-columns-of-a-pandas-dataframe/

## Specify File Path: points at the path for the Excel Workbook.
projection_file = "C:\\Users\\Mcowa\\OneDrive\\Documents\\UofT\\Current\\CSCA20 - Introduction to Programming\\Project\\Spreadsheets\\Sheet 1 - Dom's Projections.xlsx"
# Assigns the file path string (characters, numbers, symbols, or whitespace) to the projection_file variable.

## Pandas Data Frame code:
df = pd.DataFrame() # Creates a new Data Frame to store player data; like a customized Spreadsheet (DFs are how panda uses/messes with data - similar situation as in R).
drafted_players = [] # Variable holding empty list to store drafted players; pandas uses "[]" to denote lists.
## df.info: concise summary for testing (like summary/glimpse in R); double-checks that the DF is working.

## Setup Team & Opponents:
teams = { 'myteam': [], 'team2': [], 'team3': [], 'team4': [] } # Sets up a dictionary {} with key-value pairs ("myteam': [] ...) associated with an empty list "[]".
                                                                # Keys are 'myteam', 'team2', 'team3', 'team4'; value associated is the empty list '[]' for each.
